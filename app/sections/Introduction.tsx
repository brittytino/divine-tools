// 10 different pain texts that are attractive and manipulative
const painTexts = [
    `You're juggling college, placements, and last-minute projects yet tools to help you are scattered, complex, or just plain boring.`,
    `Deadlines are crushing you, assignments pile up endlessly, and every productivity app feels like it was designed by someone who never faced real student pressure.`,
    `You're drowning in a sea of tabs, forgetting passwords, switching between apps, while your GPA slowly bleeds away with each wasted minute.`,
    `Your dream job slips further away each day as you waste precious hours on clunky tools instead of actually learning and growing.`,
    `Everyone else seems to have it figured out while you're still wrestling with basic tools that should just work but never do.`,
    `You're spending more time fighting with your tools than actually using them, watching opportunities pass by as you struggle with the basics.`,
    `Your productivity setup is a house of cardsâ€”one crashed app, one lost file, one forgotten password away from complete chaos.`,
    `You're paying for subscriptions to tools you barely use, apps that don't talk to each other, and solutions that create more problems than they solve.`,
    `Every semester starts with new resolutions and ends with the same digital mess, the same scattered workflow, the same stress-induced breakdowns.`,
    `You know you're capable of more, but your current tools are holding you back from reaching your true potential and achieving the success you deserve.`
